# Matplotlib_Project

This project aims to analyze data gathered from various drug treatments on a small population of mice (249). The data was pre-processed using Pandas and visualizations were illustrated with Matplotlib. 

Plots generated included:
- the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen throughout the course of the study
- a pie chart that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.
- a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all treatment regimens with highlighted outliers
- a randomly selected mouse treated with Capomulin generated a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point
- a scatter plot of tumor volume versus mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment regimen.
- Linear regression lines on prevously computed scatter plots 

There are observeable trends written atop the Jupyter Notebook File as well.
